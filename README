Slide - Simple lightweight intuitive desktop environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The name already says it - this is a desktop environment.
Currently its a VERY basic one. You're welcome to adapt it
to your needs or create apps for it.
It uses wxWidgets as GUI-Toolkit and bases directly on X11

If you want to try it already, you should do the following:
* Compile wxWidgets 2.8 using the --with-x11 switch on configure.
* You'll need to have libpng, libjpeg and libtiff.
* Create a /etc/Slide.conf (see the Slide.conf in the repo for
  example.
* Create a ~/.slidestarter for the Starter-App (see the one in
  repo for an example)
* Put "Slide" in your ~/.xinitrc

Features already implemented:
* Virtual desks (workspaces)
* Switch between desks using STRG+Left arrow/Right arrow
* Move windows between desks pushing out of the screen on the left or right edge
* Tile/Untile visible windows using CTRL+TAB / CTRL+ALT+TAB
* Usual ALT+TAB behaviour
* Window decoration with close/maximize
* Maximize / Restore
* Close windows

If you have any questions, just write me a message.
